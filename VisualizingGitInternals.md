# Visualizing Git Internals

Understanding Git can be a challenge. Many of us attain some productive level
with it and move on with our lives. But what if we unlocked the core concepts?
Would it improve how we use it? Would it be fun?

In this talk we will take a visual approach, using construction paper, to
explore the internals of Git. By the end we should have a good understanding
of how most Git commands work.

Git can be fun. Construction paper is always fun. This talk should be fun.

Rough agenda:

- Intro.
- Brief overview of version control
- Overview of Git
- Explore the objects in Git
- Visualize some import Git commands
- Wrap up, Questions.
