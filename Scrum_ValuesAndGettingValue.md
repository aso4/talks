# Scrum: Values and Getting Value

If you are doing Scrum, but not getting much value from it, this talk is for you. It starts with a review of Scrum Fundamentals, then describes common scenarios where Scrum gets off-course. Bring your questions!

This will be a change from our normally technical talks and give a peek into development processes used at some companies.
