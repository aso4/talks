# Real Refactoring

Sometimes refactoring can seem like a daunting task, but in the end the practice is worth it. This
talk is a brief overview of why you should be actively refactoring even if you are the only
developer on your team. We'll go through a few examples extracted(and simplified) from a real
codebase.
